These datasets were derived from several published datasets, and were produced for use in the following manuscript: 

Safford, Hugh D., A.K. Paulson, Z.L. Steel, D.J.N. Young, and R. Wayman. XXXX. The 2020 California fire season: A year like no other? A return to the past? Or a harbinger of the future? XXXX XX:XX-XX. 

**Description:** Data extracted for each point on a 90 m grid within each fire boundary from the 40 largest fires in California, USA during 2020. Most of these data are derived from existing datasets, as described below. The exception is fire severity data, some of which was derived from the Rapid assessment of Vegetation Condition after Wildfire [RAVG](https://burnseverity.cr.usgs.gov/ravg/) dataset, and some of which we produced with Google Earth Engine using a modified version of [Parks et al. (2018)](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/10/6/879).

**Code:** The R code for deriving these datasets and conducting the analyses from the paper is located at [https://github.com/akpaulson/2020_Fires_GEB](https://github.com/akpaulson/2020_Fires_GEB).
